# Statistical Computation
This repository contains a collection of reports from a Statistical Computation course I attended this year, where I analyzed various statistical computing algorithms. The topics covered include:
- Sampling methods such as Acceptance-Rejection  
- Kernel Density Estimation  
- Bootstrapping  
- Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Gaussian Mixture  

The reports provide both practical implementations and simulations, offering a deeper understanding of these fundamental statistical methods.
